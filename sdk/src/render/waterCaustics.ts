 * @file    waterCaustics.ts
 * @brief   The net of light a rippled surface throws on what is under it, as one pattern the Water shader and the Underwater effect both draw.
 *
 * @details A wave focuses the sun where its surface curves like a lens, and the light on the bottom is a web of bright threads on a darker ground that
 *          swims as the waves move. This is not a simulation of that: it is the picture of it, made from two fields of value noise drifting past each
 *          other at three scales. Where the two fields are equal is a bright thread, and the threads of the three scales laid over one another make
 *          the web. It needs only a position on the surface and the time, so the same pattern is found wherever it is asked, from above the water through
 *          the surface (the Water shader, lighting what it refracts) and from below it (the Underwater effect, lighting what the camera sees and the
 *          light it walks through).
 *
 *          The pattern is written once per shading language and placed in each shader's source; the scale, the speed and the strength are the
 *          Water material's, and the Underwater effect is given the same ones, so the two halves agree about what the light is doing.
