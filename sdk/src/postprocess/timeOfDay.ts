 * @file  timeOfDay.ts
 * @brief Where the sun and the moon are at an hour of the day, and what that does to the light, the fog and the sky.
 *
 * @details The sun is placed by the astronomy that fits in four lines — an hour angle, a latitude and a declination — so a
 *          day has the right shape (a long arc in summer, a low one in winter, sunrise toward the east) with three numbers a
 *          person can understand. Everything else is the same idea as the weather: MULTIPLIERS of what the scene already
 *          says (the sun at its strength times a curve, the fog's colour times how dark it is) so the same hour fits any
 *          scene. The moon stands opposite the sun and is the directional light's aim while the sun is down.
 *
 *          The state is applied in two places, as the weather's is: to the lights (in play mode, from the weather
 *          system, which owns the lights so the two scale one number and not each other's last answer) and to the
 *          effects the volumes resolve.
