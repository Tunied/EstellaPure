 * @file    AotEvents.ts
 * @brief   A frame's payloads, as memory a compiled system can walk.
 *
 * @details An event is a JS object on a bus, and compiled code reads addresses.
 *          So each payload this frame is flattened into a block laid out in the
 *          order the manifest declares — the same order the code reads at — and
 *          the reader is handed one row per payload.
 *
 *          Sending is the same trade backwards: the code appended numbers, and
 *          the object is rebuilt from that field list before it goes on the bus.
