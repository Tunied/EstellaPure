 * @file    ScriptPool.ts
 * @brief   Flat storage for a script component whose fields are all scalars.
 *
 * @details A `defineComponent` component is a JS object per entity, which is
 *          fine for the interpreter and impossible for compiled code: a compiled
 *          system reaches a component by ADDRESS, and a JS object has none. So a
 *          component whose defaults are entirely numbers and booleans is stored
 *          in one Float64Array instead, and what callers hold is a live view
 *          onto a row of it.
 *
 *          The layout is the ABI's, not one chosen here: declaration order, one
 *          f64 per field, which is what `packLayout` gives a `host` shape. That
 *          agreement is a contract with the compiler and a test holds it.
 *
 *          A view is LIVE, and for script components that changes nothing: the
 *          query already yields the stored object itself and `writeMutBack_`
 *          only records a Changed tick for them. Writing through a setter is the
 *          same write it always was, one indirection later.
