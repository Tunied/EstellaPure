 * @file    ripples.ts
 * @brief   The disturbance a thing makes in water: a wave equation on a grid, and the foam it leaves.
 *
 * @details A water zone that is asked to ripple keeps a square window of its surface, a few hundred world units across, as a grid of heights, and each
 *          step moves it by the wave equation (every cell is pulled toward the mean of its four neighbours, and carries the velocity it had), with a little
 *          damping so a ripple dies. A disturbance (a body entering, a body moving, a script's `disturb`) is a smooth bump put into the grid; it spreads
 *          as a ring at the wave speed. Beside the height the grid keeps a foam: fed where a disturbance was and where the water moves, and fading with time.
 *
 *          It is the CPU's, and a plain array: it runs wherever the app does, is the same on every backend, and can be read back. The window follows the camera
 *          (it is re-centred in whole cells and the contents shift with it), so a lake or an ocean of any size has ripples where they are seen, for the
 *          price of one grid. The Water shader reads it as a texture (`encode`) for the slope it adds to the waves' and for the foam.
 *
 *          The wave equation is stepped in as many substeps as keep the wave from crossing more than half a cell in one: past that it would not be stable.
