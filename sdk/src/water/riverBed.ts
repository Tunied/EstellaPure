 * @file    riverBed.ts
 * @brief   A river's bed cut into the terrain: the ground along it lowered under its surface, so the water lies in a channel instead
 *          of over grass.
 *
 * @details The bed is a trough across the river, `depth` under the surface at its middle and at the surface at its edge, its banks
 *          rising on at the slope the trough meets them with until they are back on the ground. Ground already lower (a valley the
 *          river runs down) is left as it is: the bed only cuts. The river is laid over the terrain as modifiers of a stretch each, so
 *          a point of ground is weighed against the few stations near it, and editing one river remakes only the ground along it.
