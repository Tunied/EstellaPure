 * @file    sphere.ts
 * @brief   Ground on a sphere: which squares of a cube's faces to draw, and where a square's point stands on the planet.
 *
 * @details A planet is a cube whose six faces are each a quadtree, with every point pushed out onto the sphere: a node is a square of a face
 *          (`level`, `ix`, `iz`), drawn with the same patch as flat ground, and its points are cut by distance exactly as the flat quadtree's
 *          are (quadtree.ts), only the distance is to the node's bounding sphere and the top of the tree is six faces round the planet's centre.
 *
 *          A face is (u, v) in -1 to 1. The point on the cube is `normal + tan(u * PI / 4) * a + tan(v * PI / 4) * b`, normalised: the tangent
 *          spreads the squares evenly by angle, so a node's size on the ground varies by a third from the middle of a face to its corner and not
 *          by two; it is closed in both directions (`direction` and `faceOf`), which is what lets a point be named by the face it is on.
 *
 *          Nothing here touches a renderer or a terrain: positions are in the planet's own space, its centre the origin and its radius `radius`.
