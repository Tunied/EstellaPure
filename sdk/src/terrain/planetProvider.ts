 * @file    planetProvider.ts
 * @brief   Ground on a sphere made by a generator a game names: one function of a direction, versioned, the same on every machine.
 *
 * @details The provider of flat ground (provider.ts) answers for a square of world positions; this one answers for directions from a planet's
 *          centre, because a sphere has no x and z. It is handed the unit directions to sample and the radius they are on, and gives back the height
 *          above that radius at each and, if it paints the ground, four layer weights. The same rules hold: every sample is the same function read
 *          at another direction, so two pages that share an edge share its samples; a version names an algorithm for good.
