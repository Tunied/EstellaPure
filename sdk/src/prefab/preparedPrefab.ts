 * @file    preparedPrefab.ts
 * @brief   A prefab that can be spawned in one frame, because everything it
 *          names is already in hand.
 *
 * `instantiatePrefab` is async, and every bit of that is asset loading: nested
 * prefabs, then the textures and materials the flattened entities reference. A
 * caller that wants an entity NOW — a script graph's spawn node, a bullet in a
 * system's body — cannot wait for a microtask and still hand the id to the next
 * thing it does.
 *
 * So the wait is moved: `preparePrefab` does the loading once, at the moment the
 * thing that will spawn it is itself being loaded, and keeps the flattened scene
 * with its asset handles already written in. {@link spawnPrepared} is then a
 * clone and a spawn, synchronous by construction.
 *
 * It reuses the scene path rather than reimplementing it — `flattenPrefab`,
 * `preloadSceneAssets`, `resolveSceneAssetPaths`, `loadSceneData` — so a prefab
 * spawned this way and the same prefab placed in a scene resolve identically.
