 * @file    SpringBoneSystem.hpp
 * @brief   Per-App secondary motion: runs every SpringBone chain after the animation has posed the
 *          skeleton and before the frame is drawn.
 * @details The runtime state (each chain's simulated points) lives HERE, keyed by the chain's root
 *          entity, not on the component — the split TrailSystem and ParticleSystem make, so the
 *          component stays configuration and serialization never sees the transient state.
 *
 *          Per chain, per frame: read the pose the animation gave the bones (world transforms
 *          composed from their local ones), step the simulation toward it, then write back, for each
 *          bone, the local rotation that aims it at where its child has got to. Positions of bones are
 *          never written, so a bone cannot leave its parent; only rotations change, which is what
 *          skinning needs.
