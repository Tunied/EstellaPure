 * @file  check-minigame-host — the stand-in host implements what the engine asks for.
 *
 * launch-minigame boots a WeChat/Douyin package against a shim, and a shim is
 * only worth trusting while it matches the real thing. The engine already says
 * what the real thing must provide: `MiniGameGlobal` in the SDK is documented as
 * "only the subset the engine actually uses".
 *
 * So the two are held together here. A member added to the interface and not to
 * the shim would otherwise surface as a package that "fails to launch" in CI —
 * a harness gap wearing a product bug's clothes, which is the worst way to find
 * out. Optional members (`name?()`) may be skipped; required ones may not.
